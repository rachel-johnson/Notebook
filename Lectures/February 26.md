# Lecture: Module 3 - The Virtual World of the Past
---
Module 3 = digital things to digital worlds

- Immersion: how do you engage with digital objects that are about the past?
    - with the most appropraite medium
- Produce something for the module which ties together digital worlds/games with previous module creations
- Chris Crawford
    - Games = vehicle for education
    - Original educational technology - from natural selection
    - Four qualities: 
        - representation (external situations)
        - interaction (player influences world & gets meaningful response)
        - conflict (goal)
        - safety (safe ways to experience real situations)
- MDA (Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics)
    - Model three dimensions to measure game - useful scheme
- Why do historians care?
    - what are games/simulations for? (Jeremiah McCall)
        - they pose meaningful questions about the past 
        - evaluate and analyze the past
        - discriminate between essential and trivial aspects of historical events
        - analyze dymanic systems (interrelationships)
    - All reconstructions of the past are interpretations - dependent on historians who create them 
-  We play games for the pleasure of finding out what happens next
-  Same motivation for historians:
    - learn what happened, why they happened
        - simulations help answer this
- Simulations = interpretations 
    - also the historical monograph is
- Procedural literacy
    - procedural rhetorics (need to understand to have literacy)
    - mechanisms of game = historiographic tradition
- What makes a game historical? What makes a historical game good? 
    - genres = marketing categories
- Ludology = study of games (as unique field)
    - ludus = rule-based games
    - paidea = free-form games
    - narratology = study of storytelling (games as story systems)
    - a typology of time of space
        - classify in order to judge how it is suited to a particular purpose
- Classifying games:
    - how can representing time/space correspond with historical episodes?
    - digitalization of history in video games combines spatialization, virtualization, and simulation - eliminates representation as the medium anchoring historical action to historical consciousness (Fogus, 121)
- Alternate Reality Games
    - maybe best mode for historians?
- Ergodic Texts
    - "require performance to be understood" & "mechanical organization of text"
    - ex. Choose Your Own Adventure series
    - play and read simultaneously
    - Espen Aarseth - "ergodic" = requiring work to read
- I Love Bees - elaborate backstory & consuming narrative
    - transmedia puzzles to move story forward
    - parallel to everyday reality - players gradually become aware, form communities to unravel story
    - Tecumseh Lies Here (another ex)
- Is it right to screw with history? What happens when people don't realize it's not a game?
- ARGS for History: The Killer App
    - Value to historians for:
        - immersive, authentic experience
        - think like a historian to succeed
        - allows/inhabits multiple viewpoints 
        - emergent meaning making
- Dangers for historians?
    - allegories of control, illuminating, of unknown masses
    - "present evidence of story, let players tell it to themselves" (Stewart)
    - historical research is the game
- Prairie, Twine
    - to make games (see FAQ)
