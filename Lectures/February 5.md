- Trailer "Scary Mary" - as an example of remixing, rearranging already existing elements to create something new
- Watling Street - remix of code in sound, to better understand/recontextualize Roman coin data in Britain
- Two Trains - similar remix of data into sound but for economy in NY
- Some DJ's remix to create new music - use data across mediums
- Remixing can do good or harm - idea of ancient's having help from aliens (racism)
- Plaques remixed - Departement of Recreation & Conservation (as way of addressing institutionalized racism in NA)
- Remixing vs. Mixing
    -  're' implies returning, regressing - negative thing (problematic)
    -  'mix' creates something new - finds something from the source materials that was latent
- Topic Models - documents remixed - distribution of words = visualizations
- John Adams Mind - example of sonification
- Deformance and Interpretation (McGann & Samuels)
    - Idea of reading a text backwords - reavitalizes the text and makes it performative
- Deformed Humanities (Sample)
    - No need to return to the original text - make a new text/artifact
    - Idea of deformance vs. deformation
    - The broken is beautiful

Ways to mix data:
- sonification
- twitterbots
- generative grammars
- recurrent neutral networks
- maps
- 3d scene mashups
- 3d file mashups
