Computational Creativity

-	Fits in with AI – trying to figure out if computers are creative
    -	Actions that would be creative if a human did it
    -	A lot of effort put into discussing what “creativity” looks like
-	Need to refocus on the final thing – is it creative?
    -	Problematic thing to ask
-	Mancis the Poet example 
    -	Computer composing and naming piece of music
    -	Neuro networks – no one really understands how it works
        -	People provide training data
    -	Is it creative? – could just be an algorithm
-	Some kind of humanity involved – makes original definition a red herring
    -	Focus more on outcomes
-	These are the wrong questions
    -	Better question = What are these things? Why are they the way they are? How did they get this way? What do they mean?
    -	Entanglement – an object is associations and entangled lines of being with other things
        -	Ways of mapping broader system of relationships
        -	Our job – to map them and work through historical implications
        -	Never a neutral way of using technology – only a mindful way
    -	Play, work, or labour – to work out aspects related to political economy
-	Framework – for working through implications (ontological)
    -	Time for some archaeological theory
    -	Things computers make – about transformation of one kind of info/data into something else
    -	To make something computational – have to be able to define boundaries
-	Process of drawing boundaries – in archeology
    -	Can contain negative events
        -	Find evidence of things that don’t physically exist – but is meaningful
-	Things you dig, things created from digging
    -	Transform physical world into nothingness – less paper behind you
    -	Forces of things that persists and define how able things are to change
        -  	See charts in slides
        -	Forces that interfere in the material – material to dematerial
        -	Victims of Vesuvius as example – voids within the rock
            -	Discover voids, fill them up, pseudomorph (false bodies)
            -	Skeuomorph 
-	How do we understand the bodies of Pompeii?
    -	Find them as voids
    -	Create a vast number of other things – what is their meaning?
        -	Digital things now with the non-spaces 
        -	Is it still a human body?
-	Framework for understand the different points of digital things
    -	if they are meaning – how are they meaningful?
-	Two grids
    -	Permeability vs. persistence
        -	Forces defining the qualities of object
    -	Enchainment vs. containment
        -	Forces defining the processes of assembly/disassembly
-	Tracing victims – Grid 1 (more in line with our work)
    -	Day before – living person
    -	After – body won’t last long, starts to decompose
    -	Imprint in the stone – surrounds and embraces the void
    -	Fill void with clay – break surrounding stone away (fleeting)
    -	Casts – now curated object (of the past and present simultaneously)
    -	Pseudomorph – send to museums, etc
    -	Skeuomorph, resin, digital, 3d print – deep time dimension	
        -	Super complicated chain of intervening objects resulting from the void
        -	About the quality of the object – relationship between each quality 
-	Grid 2 
    -	Victim – corpse – void/imprint – pseudomorph – mould/resin/reduction – skeuomorph – publication – archive, etc. 
    -	Process of movement 
    -	Help us understand what these objects mean 
-	Archaeological theory is about things we find in the present that tell stories about the past
    -	Useful framework to understand what’s involved in the meaning of our objects
-	What does this have to do with computational creativity?
    -	Framework to understand things computers make
    -	Humans part of the process – to recognize that we become creative to interfere with qualities of objects through machines
    -	Forces to think about edges – how they match up or smear against each other
    -	Forces us to see things as blurred, not bounded 
    -	Enables us to work out entanglements and causal relationships between those entanglements
        -	History asks why – need to see edges to answer
-	What is the ontological meaning of your projects?
    -	Where is the creativity in your models?
    -	How do your models fit on these frameworks? Why?
    -	What do you see when you try to map the moments, the glitches, the voids and spaces?
