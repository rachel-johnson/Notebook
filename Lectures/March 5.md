-	Bohemia 15th c – huge melting pot
    -	Lots of complex things
    -	Video game takes place in this setting (Kingdom Come: Deliverance)
        -	Sets up story 
        -	versatility, realism 
        -	already starts with conflict between 2 brothers 
        -	Othering takes place – clear binary within game
        -	Constructing its own vision of the past – programing as series of forgetting
    -	Retelling history = always chooses what to omit 
    -	What is worthy of representation? 
        -	Issues of authenticity/realism vs. fun
        -	Race – game has just white, but historically there was a mix of races 
        -	What kind of past do audiences want to remember?
        -	Anyone not male and white in the game = other
        -	Not in line with historical Bohemia, but in line with modern policies 
    -	Argument about current situation 
-	Questions about representation in a ‘historical’ game:
    -	Who’s the villain?
    -	Who’s the hero?
    -	Who matters to the story?
    -	Who’s left out?
-	Questions of mechanics:
    -	Are these actions reasonable/meaningful in the context in this era?
    -	Are these actions meaningful within context of the game?
-	Counterfactual
    -	Some explore possible things given our understanding of the past
    -	Some are impossible – lot of gamers talk about this 
    -	Brings into world of simulation 
-	Mechanics matter in what they permit the player to do 
    -	Frame actions in larger context 
-	Games are just a system of interactions – matter to the player and what is committed
    -	We need to figure out relationship
-	The graphics don’t matter a bit
    -	We get caught up in the graphics – computing power could go towards something else
    -	Get in the way of thinking about how video games represent the past
        -	Only way we understand the past is through vision – which is wrong
        -	Memory and knowing about the past is part of our embodied spirit
    -	Ex: smell triggers memory 
    -	Disney research – touch 
        -	Tara Copplestone http://taracopplestone.co.uk/
-	Critical play
    -	Path of Honours
        -	Focus on Roman life from perspective of young man
        -	Military life
        -	We would like more context to make choices
        -	Political Roman life
