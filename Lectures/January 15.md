# Module 1: Lecture 1

Housekeeping
-	Keep an eye on annotation stream – to see others work/problem solving, etc
-	Website to export hypothesis annotations - http://jonudell.net/h/facet.html
    -	Useful for own research 
    -   Can do distant reading, text analysis, view patterns

Photogrammetry
-	First step in critical digital making = scanning something in real world and making digital 
-	Part of larger universe of photographic approaches to mapping, historic restoration, recording of material in space, etc. 
-	Intersection of techniques
    -	Number of different ways of doing this – most common in apps for phone is structure from motion
        -	Person rotates around the object – could use video as stills to 3d model capture
        -	Google Earth/maps
-	Can use high end laser with rotating mirror inside – shoots billions of points of light against objects to map them
    -	Very expensive and complex
-	Just need a camera – good quality photographs
    -	Can make 3d models of artifacts – to make more accessible 
    -	Can make a model from video – use stills 
    -	123Dcatch – program that was cancelled – big tech firms keep cancelling or buying out smaller firms 
        -	Need to think about sustainability (of the program)
        -	Sketchfab – has a lot of cultural heritage stuff from different museums
    -	Augmented reality experience
        -	Create own application that will always work
        -	People want an experience – almost have to tell a framing story
            -	About why your looking at something through your phone
-	English Heritage
    -	Archeology consumes what it studies – it destroys it
        -	A lot starting to experiment with creating 3d models of a site everyday
        -	Makes record they can put back together – research applications
    -	Put out guideline for photogrammetry
-	Basic principle
    -	Clean, clear, sharp photos from variety of angles and depths
    -	Image matching – machine takes images and matches locations of overlap, generates cloud of likely connections, then generates secondary product (3d model)
    -	Then can analyse and present – integrate into other things
-	High degree of overlap 
    -	Really important
    -	Never get a good model with anything less than 15 photos (over 30 is overkill)
        -	Optimal is 20-30 images
    -	Computer identifies same points (tie points) through image and colour 
    -	When your camera takes photographs, computer in phone imbeds metadata 
        -	Includes size of image plates, depth between lens and plate
    -	Computer reverse engineers – works out where the camera was relate to the image
    -	Generate little dots with a little bit of colour (dense point cloud generated)
        -	Then reconstruct
-	Once done all this – download to your computer and clean up with a program
-	See slides to look at sites with models
