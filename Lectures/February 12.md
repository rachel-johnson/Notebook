# Lecture: Module 2 - Museums and 3d Scanning
---

Unfortunately I was unable to attend lecture on February 12 as I was sick, but I did go through the presentation slides:

Plaster Casts & Sculptures in Museums:
- Video on making plaster casts - technique which goes back to Ancient Egypt, used in Renaissance
- Early motivations - Parthenon frieze video (relief carvings)
    - Private collectors and the creation of the canon occurred
    - National academies of the arts created, emergence of nation states
- Exhibitions of plaster casts - 1855 (became popular in Europe)
    - They became industrialized - with the Cast Courts which opened in 1873
    - Tied to Napoleonic ivasions returning with copies and originals (from Italy, Egypt, etc.)
- Academia became industrialized - a lot of sculpture and plastor casts of sculptures on display in museums (Museo della Civilta' Romana as example) - standardization and systematization
- There was a shift away from plastor casts - no longer viewed as art, just cheap replicas (museums as sites of cultural hegemony)
- Another shift occurred later - redemption for casts
    - When casts which showed the original state of a sculpture (began in 1970s)
    - Teaching value, idea of simulacra for artists
    - ex: Greek sculpture casts with full original colour and no missing limbs 

How have museums dealth with the Digital?
- Problems:
    - Models and modelling?
    - Downloading data?
    - Remixing data?
    - Charging fees?
- Canadian Museums?
- The biggest fear = Misuse
    - How to monitor how the objects are used when they become digital?
    - Have a duty to make objects widely available - to outweight colonial damage done in originally collecting them
- Need infrastructure to answer
- Develop a 3d digital heritage ecosystem
    - The role of the virtual museums in the 21st century
    - The problem of the loosened copy - embed provenance and providence
    - Idea of the original heritage object loosing its meaning the more it's changed digitally
