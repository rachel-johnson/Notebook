# Discussion: Module 3 - Twine Entry Ticket
---
Instead of a discussion this week, there was a [Twine](http://twinery.org/) challenge. This challenge required us to create a twine experience of our entry ticket:

- I followed the instructions provided by Professor Graham.
- I used my entry ticket as the first page, and then used the [Hist 3812 Commonplace Book](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vvGHdc3sGDwJSzwNhPZEU9ioLWkMi0oouy6n0llOZZg/edit#gid=998852344) for all subsequent pages. 
- I found that once I was accustomed to the way Twine worked, it was fairly simple to build the experience. 
- I also found that many of the passages from the Commonplace Book made sense when combined, which was interesting in terms of the areas in the readings which stand out to students. 

I really liked this challenge and found it a neat way to integrate our entry tickets in a more hands-on than discussing them.
