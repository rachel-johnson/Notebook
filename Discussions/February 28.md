# Discussion: Module 3 - Twinery
---
Unfortunately I was sick this week, and had to miss the twinery donut challenge.

- The class was given an hour to create their own interactive text experience/game on [Twine](http://twinery.org/) in groups
- Afterwords their games were posted on CULearn for the class to vote on which one was the best
- While I wasn't able to participate in class, I did look at each game and vote.
- I really liked the differences between each one and found that they were very fun to play. 
- It made me very interested in Twine, as I am personally very drawn to text based interactive experiences.
